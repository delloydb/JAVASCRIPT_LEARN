# 📚 JavaScript Learning Journey

Welcome to my JavaScript study repository! This space is dedicated to documenting my progress, experiments, and projects as I learn and master JavaScript — the language of the web.

## 🧠 Why JavaScript?

JavaScript is a powerful, versatile, and essential programming language for building dynamic web applications. Whether it's adding interactivity to websites, building backend services with Node.js, or creating full-stack apps, JavaScript is at the heart of modern web development.

## 📆 Current Focus

I'm currently working through:

- ✅ JavaScript fundamentals (variables, loops, functions)
- ✅ DOM manipulation
- 🔄 ES6+ features (arrow functions, destructuring, etc.)
- ⏳ Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, async/await)
- 📦 Modules & modern tooling (Bundlers, NPM)

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build real-world projects using vanilla JS
- Gain a strong understanding of core JS concepts
- Transition to frameworks like React.js with a solid JS foundation

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- JavaScript (Vanilla ES6+)
- HTML & CSS (for integration)
- Node.js (optional for later backend exploration)
